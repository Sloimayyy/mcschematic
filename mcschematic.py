BY SLOIMAY 2022 :D
Based on Fearless' implementation that he took from someone else
that he doesn't remember the name of
Well now mschematic kinda grew out of hands so like now pretty much 20
lines out of the 2,000 is fearless' implementation lMFAO

Versions (last is current):
1 - 15/06/2022
    - MCSchematic starts its journey, I only started logging what happened on version 8
      so I have no idea how the first version looked like lmfAO

2 - 18/06/2022

3 - 28/06/2022

4 - 30/06/2022

5 - 10/08/2022

6 - 14/09/2022

7 - 17/09/2022
    - New load feature :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
    - Also new fancy BlockDataDB
    
8 - 18/09/2022 
    - Made mcschematic 3 to 30 times faster while saving, 
      and 2 to 10 times faster while loading from a file!! :DDDD
    - Also BlockDataDB overhaul!!

9 - 20/09/2022: The editing update!!!
    - Added a lot of getters
    - Changed the internals of MCSchematic for the blocks and blockPalettes to be
      in a form of a MCStructure class, for easier editing
    - editing tools added:
        - schematic pasting into another schematic
        - translation
        - xyz scaling
        - naive rotation (no rotation of block states)
        - flip

10 - 25/09/2022: The big and cool update for big schematics!!
    - Changed the "fromSS" method in classes in BlockDataDB because it
      didn't work :skull emoji:   python "self" keyword moment
    - Fixed a bug in .setBlock where if you placed a blockEntity at a spot,
      then a blockState in the same spot, the blockEntity data will still remain,
      and could potentially also be returned by .getBlockDataAt()
    - Went from using floor() to round() in transform methods like translate etc,
      because it makes transforms such as rotate symmetric. Now what does that mean?
      Basically rotate(14 degrees) and rotate(-14 degrees) are supposed to be a flipped
      version of each other. But using floor() makes the rotated blocks have a snapping 
      bias towards -XYZ, so they end up not being the same. Whereas round() removes that bias.
    - Also added the possibility of using non-ints anchor points in transform methods.
    - Added generation methods:
        - cuboidFilled
        - cuboidHollow
        - cuboidOutlined
    - Added varint support!!! Before having more than 128 blockStates in the blockPalette of
      a structure or schematic would make it not save correctly. That's because schem files
      uses varint encoding and not "one byte is one block state", and "the next byte is another blockState".
      Now for palettes under 128 in length, saving can be pretty quick. However if more, even for the
      same size of schematics, it might be way, wayyy slower.
      Also loading a schematic from disk also takes longer if the palette is more than 128 long. 
      As we need to decode each varint, we get faced with in the byte stream!

11 - 27/09/2022: the moar editing update??? :OOOOO
                 nope! It's the full release 1! More commonly known as "MCSchematic 11-Release"
    - added horizontal rotation of block states when using the rotate() transform
    - added horizontal flipping of block states when using the flip() transform
    - added "getSubStructure()" and "getSubSchematic()" methods making you able to
      get only a portion of a main schematic.
    - added the "centerAround()" transformation which will center the structure at the inputted
      anchor point as best as it can with integer coordinates
    - added the "center()" transformation which will center the structure around 0, 0, 0 as
      best as it can with integer coordinates
    - fixed bug in .getBounds() where the xyzMins and Maxes would be initialized to 0, meaning
      that for example if a structure was in the XYZ+ octant of the 3d space, it's minXYZ would
      still be 0, 0, 0. Now initializing mins to -2^30 and maxes to 2^30, not sure how python
      handles numbers close to the integer limit, if its gonna add bits to them or not, so I prefer
      playing it safe and make sure they stay 32 bit numbers so that bounds computation can be as
      fast as possible!
    - Added docstrings for all "publicly" available methods! (this took 3 hours it was so boring help me)
